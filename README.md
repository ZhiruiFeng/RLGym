# RLGym

This is a personal "Lieutenant" (Leaning level) project for reinforcement learning.

## Reference

Book:
* Sutton & Barto's book [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)

GitHub repositories:
* Denny Brize’s [reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning)
* Shangtong Zhang’s [reinforcement-learning-an-introduction]( https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction)

## Goal

- Under 'learn' directory, through Jupyter Notebook, I reappear some experiments done in this book. This project is totally for self-learning purpose, and the code here are refer to the repositories I mentioned in reference. What I have done is rearrange the structure of the experiments code with my own understanding, which I think can help me gain deeper understanding.

## Environment
- Python 3.6.4
- TensorFlow 1.4.0
- OpenAI Gym 0.9.4

## Content
- lib: the game environment
- play: some test for fun
- learn: exercises for learning
